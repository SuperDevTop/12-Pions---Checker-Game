The game I want is like the game of checkers but this time for this game there are 25 cages and each player has 12 pawns.
Rule number 1: the movement is only horizontally and vertically but there is no moving backward just to the left, right or forward
Rule number 2: the player has the right to eat the other pawn only when there is an empty cage after the pawn
Rule number 3: the player can play more times than when he eats a pawn and there is another pawn that he can eat. But itâ€™s only the pawn he played that can do that
Rule number 4: if the player who has to play a pawn who can eat a pawn and he decides not to eat it and to play some other pawn must be deleted as if we had eaten it
Rule number 5: if a pawn of a player arrived at the first line of the opponent, pawn becomes a king pawn, a king pawn means that this pawn can move vertically and horizontally even backwards by jumping cages and eating pawns by jumping cages, but he cannot jump these own pawns
Rule number 6: if a player eats all the opponent's pawns, this player wins the game.
Rule number 7: if for each player he has 1 pawn left, we have a draw no one has won
